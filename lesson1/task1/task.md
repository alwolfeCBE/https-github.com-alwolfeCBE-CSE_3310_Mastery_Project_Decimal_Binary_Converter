<h2>Mastery Project 2: Recursive Converter</h2>
Directions: Complete the following program on intelliJ and push to the github repositary 

You will make a program that reclusively converts between base-10 and base-2 values. In order to think recursively for these problems, do a conversion by hand first. Notice the base case, then write your recursive algorithm.
You will write one class with 3 methods: the main method that will test your conversions, and four static methods that do the following:
<code>
/* This method accepts a base-2 number as a String
* and recursively converts it into a base-10 (decimal)
* number represented as a int
*/
public static int binToDec(String binary)

/* This method accepts a base-10 number as an int
* and recursively converts it into a base-2 (binary)
* number represented as a String
*/
public static String decToBin(int decimal)
</code>
Test your method with both binary and base-10 values.  Make sure to document and cite any references in your code.  Also, include a comment where you explain how you tested your algorithm.  This comment should also contain pasted output from your tests.
